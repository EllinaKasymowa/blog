Hello dear friends. Let's talk about the past week. Last week the weather was terribly cold, but this did not stop us from celebrating the holiday on March 8th. It was sunny that day. All people went for a walk, had fun and celebrated with their loved ones and loved ones. There was little to do that week and many managed to relax and cheer themselves up. The week was very busy. But I not only rested, but also studied on my own, did laboratory work and taught lectures in mathematics.
